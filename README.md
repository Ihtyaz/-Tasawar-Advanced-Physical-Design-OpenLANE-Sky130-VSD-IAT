The repository is intended to house all proceedings, compilations and documents/reports pertaining to the [Advanced Physical Design](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/advanced-physical-design-using-openlane-sky130/) workshop organized and conducted by [VSD-IAT](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/).

Any discrepancies or misrepresentations are to be formally reported to the author.

The following sections would discuss and elaborate on the different topics that have been discussed within the workshop.

## 1. Inception of open-source EDA, OpenLANE and Sky130 PDK

* Fundamental Terminologies

*IC Package* - The term is associated to the enclosure that houses the semiconductor circuit design or device. This is generally practiced to protect the contents from corrosion or physical stress. In addition, it also facilitates electrical connection on a Printed Circuit Board (PCB). The type of IC packaging depends on the type of design the package will house and the associated requirments.

*Wire Bonds* - A method pursued in order to facilitate boundary pin connections between the IC device (chip) and the packaging system.

*Pads* - Pads serve as pathway for the transmission of signals to the chip or away from the chip, that is, for the transmission of input and output signals.

*Core* - The core region within a design is where all the associated digital logic components are situated.

*Die* - Die refers to the entirety of a chip that gets manufactured on a silicon wafer.
